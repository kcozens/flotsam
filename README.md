#README#

This is a historical repository that is not currently under active development
(though patches may still be applied from time to time).

It currently only consists of one server, XmlRpcGroups, which is commonly used
as a third-party groups implementation for OpenSimulator [1].  Please see the
README.md in flotsam/Servers/XmlRpcGroupsServer for more details.
